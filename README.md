# Hangman-React

Little hangman game for react. 


```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```

This project was built using React and Material UI. It's made up of 5 different components. I think the biggest technical challenge was comparing guesses, to the word, as well as filling in the blank spaces after a user had guessed. I leveraged lodash to do some of the heavy lifting here.
